Basic web application that uses the webcamera to take pictures at semi-regular intervals and upload them to a server. The application is designed to be used as an invigilator to ensure your brats are studying and not goofing off.

Intended to be fully agentically vibe-coded.

See the copilot-instructions for design and implementation details.
